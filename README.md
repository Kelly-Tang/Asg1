# Project Name: Kelly's Portfolio
The overview of this website it, this project or website is for the recruiters, if they want to hire people doing 3D or 2D artwork. This website have different kind of artwork and art style. I am able to do a concept art, or if there is a need to change the game loading screen or logo. As for 3D, I am able to finish the house, cartoonish model.
## Design Process: 
The purpose of me making this website is because, for the future, after graduating, I will need to find work. This website is made for the companies. When they see my website online, they may be interested and ask to have an interview. And if Covid-19 continues, I am able to send my personal website to the interviewer, to take a look at my website, the artworks, or the games I had done. I have made different kinds of shops logo, fictional shops.
